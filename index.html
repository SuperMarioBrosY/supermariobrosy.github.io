  <h2>CREDITS AND SPECIAL NOTICES</h2>
  <p>and more</p>
  <p>Super Mario Bros Y was inspired by Super Mario Bros X, Super Wah Bros (on Scratch) and Super Boom Boom World (on Scratch).

Huge thanks to the Super Mario Bros. X website for the download zip file which comes with all the files including graphics, music and more.

Another big thanks to @Brad-Games (on Scratch and itch.io) for the original Super Mario Bros. 3 for Scratch project (on ScRaTcH). Without it, this game would not be possible.

Changelog:
v0.0: Unfinished and not even public yet
v 1.0: Official release

If you find any bugs, please let me know!

Also the Super Leaf is broken. I'm not sure why
